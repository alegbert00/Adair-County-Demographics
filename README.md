# AdairCountyDemographics
My group and I were tasked with using an interactive graphing method to display the research findings of our choice.  We investigated the demographics of the three largest towns in Adair County, with an emphasis on the city of Kirkville. Our code and website can be found here.

The aim was to analyze various aspects of population dynamics in Kirksville and its neighboring towns. We wanted to explore trends in Kirksville's population size over the years, seeking to identify any patterns or significant changes, and to see how they compare to the trends in Novinger and Brashear. A key focus will be on how the demographics of race and ethnicity in Kirksville and its surrounding areas have evolved from 2013 to 2021. We also wanted to investigate whether there is a relationship between population trends and demographic changes in each of these towns. Another aspect of this research was to examine trends in the median annual income in Kirksville and its neighboring towns during the same period. We wanted to determine if Kirksville has maintained the highest median annual income compared to its neighboring towns consistently from 2013 to 2021.  Finally, we wanted to see if COVID or the student population of Truman affected demographics.
